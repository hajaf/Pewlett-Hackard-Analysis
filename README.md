The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

##	Results: 

•	There is no proper record of which individaul swiched to what filed within the retirement table which would have been useful

•	For the mentors we did not check for duplicates so there may be individuals that appear twice but changes roles and thus we believe there are more mentors than there are.

•	A good number of hires were born with in 1965 one year as compared to the eligible mentor who were born between 1952 to 1955 for years. This means that the employment rate has decreased as time has gone by which may be the purpose of this mentorship

•	If the purpose of this mentorship program is to replace the soon to be retiring workers, then the mentors need to mentor more than one person at a time because the amount of people retiring surpass those eligible for the mentorship program. as seen in the images below there are 7636 staff alone that are retiring and 1549 are eligible for the mentor ship program.
